# Abstract Factory Pattern

The Abstract Factory Pattern provides an interface for creating families of related 
objects without specifying their concrete classes. Itâ€™s beneficial when creating 
product families that should be used together.

## Use Cases:

* When you want to enforce the use of related objects that share a common theme.
* Creating UI components for multiple platforms, where each platform has specific characteristics.
