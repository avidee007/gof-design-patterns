# Observer Pattern

The Observer Pattern defines a one-to-many relationship between objects, where one object (the "subject") notifies all
its dependent objects (the "observers") about any state changes.

## Use Cases:

Event handling systems (e.g., GUI listeners in Java).
Messaging and notification systems (e.g., stock price updates).

## Example:

Let's create a weather monitoring system where multiple devices (observers) display weather updates when the weather
station (subject) changes.
