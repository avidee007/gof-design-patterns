# Command Pattern

The Command Pattern encapsulates a request as an object, thereby allowing for parameterization of clients with different
requests, queuing of requests, and logging operations. It also provides support for undoable operations.

## Use Cases:

Implementing undo/redo functionality in applications.
Logging operations for auditing purposes.
Task scheduling in multithreaded environments.

## Example:

Let's create a simple remote control system where commands are executed to turn on/off the TV.
